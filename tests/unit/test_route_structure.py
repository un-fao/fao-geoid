"""Structural guards over the app's route table.

M11: the root ``/{geoid}`` resolver is a single-segment catch-all whose safety
depends on registration ORDER (literal routes must come first). That was
convention held by a comment; these tests make it structural.

M12: ``require_principal`` deliberately resolves to an anonymous principal, so a
future mutating route that forgets its authorization check would be silently
anonymous-writable. The inventory test forces every new mutating route through a
review: it fails until the route is added here (with its authz mechanism named).
